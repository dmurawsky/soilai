## Setup Overview

1. Installation
1. Add Your API Key
1. Setup Dev Server
1. Setup Frontend

## Installation

```bash
npm install soilai
```

or

```bash
yarn add soilai
```

## Add Your API key

If you don't have an API key yet [click here](https://soilai.dev/)

_CAUTION!_ This should only be used in development. You should never publish or commit this key to source control.

To use these features you need to set the SOILAI_API_KEY environment variable in your development environment. Follow these steps to add the SOILAI_API_KEY to your .env.development file:

### Locate or Create .env.development:

1. If you do not already have a .env.development file in the root directory of your project, create one.
1. Add the SOILAI_API_KEY:
   Open the .env.development file in a text editor and add the following line:

```bash
SOILAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace your_api_key_here with your actual SOIL AI API key.

_You may need to restart your development server_

## Add Soil AI dev server

To run the SOIL AI development server alongside your existing development server (e.g., Next.js), you'll need to modify the dev command in your package.json file. This allows both servers to run together, ensuring that Soil AI is available during development.

Steps to Update the dev Command:
Open package.json:
Locate the package.json file in the root directory of your project.

Modify the dev Command:
Update the dev script in the scripts section to include the `soilai` command followed by your existing development server command. Use a single ampersand (&) to run both servers concurrently.

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "soilai & next dev"
}
```

In this example, next dev represents the Next.js development server. If you're using a different framework, replace next dev with the appropriate command for your setup.

Save the package.json File:
After making the changes, save the package.json file.

Start the Development Servers:
Run your development server as usual by executing:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

Important Note:
The single ampersand (&) in the command allows both servers to run in parallel. This means that Soil AI will be available for real-time updates while you're developing your application.

## Setup Frontend

### JavaScript

```js
import { initializeSoilAi } from "soilai";

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  initializeSoilAi();
});
```

### React

#### Use the hook

```tsx
import { useSoilAi } from "soilai";

function App() {
  useSoilAi();

  return <h1>My App</h1>;
}
```

#### Use the component

```tsx
import { SoilAi } from "soilai";

function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <SoilAi />
    </main>
  );
}
```
